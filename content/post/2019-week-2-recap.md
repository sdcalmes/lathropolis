# Week 2 Fantasy Recap
The 2nd week of the 2019 Lathropolis fantasy football league is in the books. Are we surprised Sam is in last place? No. Are we surprised Drew is in first place? No. He's a dirty rotten cheat. That being said, Week 2 has been anything but predictable. It's been a week full of upsets, choice words, and most importantly, nervous perspiration. This week each team came out with the reckless big-dick energy only seen in the like of a Super Smash Bros. 12-man melee with 200% damage and 30 seconds left. For that reason, each matchup has been assigned a Super Smash Bros. head to head matchup (and don't forget to click the title links).

**[Bowser v. Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atU8oGa7y08)**
The Blue Jean Commitee (Victor, 2-2-0) v. D'Brettshaw Favruson (Joey, 3-1-0)

Bowser is a huge fucking dinosaur turtle! He put up the league high in points last week and no one, especially some
 big-nosed Italian plumber, is going to get in his way. Right? Well we all know how this story ends. Mario just happens to stumble across some magic mushrooms, AKA Dak Prescott and Dalvin Cook who combine for 56.95 points, and beats Bowser into jurrassic submission. While The Blue Jean Commitee looked good on paper through Week 1, they were no match for D'Brettshaw Favruson's allitertative star-studded starters, even with his kicker going for a mind-boggling -2 points.

**[Ganondorf v. AFC](https://youtu.be/joeN1Ukn_X8)**
Team 10 (Dallman, 2-2-0) v. Mertle's Acres (James, 1-3-0)

For those who didn't spend their youth wearing headsets playing Halo 2 on Xbox live, AFC stands for "Away From
 Controller." This is the name given to players who have ran upstairs to microwave a hotpocket in the middle of a Team Slayer match, often resulting in them getting killed and tea-bagged dozens of times by the opposing team. This week Mertle's Acres ran upstairs to microwave a hotpocket. He was tea-bagged a staggering 114.66 times by Gandondorf while only putting up 67.30 points. But Mertle's terrible showing isn't the only thing to contribute to Team 10's win. Team 10 showed up this week with Tom Brady, Odell, and KC defense putting up huge stats. Much of Mertle's lack of success can be attributed to Drew Brees putting up -.1 points and then getting knocked out of the game, but luckily Mertle has a great backup in Russell Wilson. Good thing James ran upstairs to microwave a hotpocket during the draft and auto-drafted him.

**[Princess Peach v. Princess Zelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oo9n89guRM)**
Team 8 (Jake, 3-1-0) v. Ligma Sacks (Luke, 1-3-0)

I get it, it's 2019, but Women's sports just aren't as fun to watch as Men's. This week's matchup between Team 8 and Ligma Sacks, with scores of 95.35 to 81.70, was about as exciting as watching D3 Women's College Billiards, and for that reason they have been assigned Princess Peach v. Princess Zelda. While each of them had a couple of tricks up their sleeves, such as Brandon Cooks putting up 3 receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown or John Ross flashing with 4 receptions for 112 yards and a touchdown, neither of them were able to beat this week's league median. Both teams are looking to turning things around in week 3.

**[Mr. Game and Watch v. Kirby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxaBWTQjdjQ)**
Saquon DEEZ NUTZ (Sam, 0-4-0) v. Kupp o Caffe (Andy, 3-1-0)

Some say if you put your ear to the ground in a silent room, you can hear Saquon DEEZ NUTZ's ass quivering from anywhere on the planet. Much like Mr. Game and Watch who was Nintendo's first ever video game character, Team Saquon DEEZ NUTZ was league champion early on in Lathropolis' history, but today their skills are just too outdated to compete in the bigs. Will this year be Saquon DEEZ NUTZ's second last place showing in 3 years? Saquon DEEZ NUTZ put up some decent numbers this week, but Kupp o Caffe shut him right the fuck up. This week, Kupp o Caffe can be compared to none other than Kirby for one reason only; he's cheap. Just like how your little sister can manage to beat you with kirby using only Down-B (Christian McCaffarey) and Up-B (Travis Kelce), Kupp o Caffe has somehow managed to aquire two players who are both historically number one in their position. But this week it wasn't C-Mac that led him to victory, but the Patriots Defense, who according to the Fantasy Footballers (which I don't listen to) are going to be the #1 streaming defense for the next 6 weeks.

**[Ness v. Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV4SY1FzPNE)**
Team Shred (Justin, 1-3-0) v. Sons of Ol' (D'James, 2-2-0)

Raise your hand if Team Shred approached you for a trade last week? While at first glance, Ness may seem like an innocent child with a yo-yo, don't be fooled. Just like Ness's facad, be warned that Team Shred may approach you with what looks like a juicy trade, but really he's just trying to set you up for some ass ink. Perhaps if he had offered more than Tyreek Hill last week, he may have been able to pull off a win. Instead, Sons of Ol' were able to roll over him like the Sons of Anarchy, putting up a nearly league-high 132.95 points. Much like Fox, who's unconvential fighting style has landed him as the [#1 Super Smash Bros. Melee Character](https://rankedboost.com/super-smash-bros/melee-tier-list/), we all thought Sons of Ol' was crazy for drafting Mahomes as early as he did. But maybe he's not crazy after all, maybe he's crazy like a fox.

**[Master Hand v. Pikachu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoIY0kJ_cZc)**
Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck (Drew, 4-0-0) v. KittleMyTittles (Joe, 2-2-0)

First of all, it's Duck Duck Goose. Secondly, Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck can be easily compared to Master hand for the simple reason that he's really fucking hard to beat. Is he maniupulating the stats? Is he colluding via email with the Sleeper staff to get a leg up? Or is he just really good at Fantasy Football? I have a bad feeling it's the latter. But just like Master Hand, a 7-year-old can beat them given enough force restarts of their Nintendo 64. In my opion, the real threat to the jacket is KittleMyTittles. If Charlie Markus has taught me anything, it takes years to master Pikachu's character, but once you do, he can't be stopped. Much like a young Charlie Markus using Pikachu, many of KittleMyTittles's players, such as Baker Mayfield, Antonio Brown, Marquise HOLLYWOOD! Brown, and others, have yet to reach their true potential. I fear that once they do, KittleMyTittles will become a force to be reckoned with.

Thats all for now folks. I hope the fantasy gods bring you good luck on the waiver wire this week  and as always, Saquon DEEZ NUTZ.
