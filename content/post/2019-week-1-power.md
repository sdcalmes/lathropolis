# Week 1 Power Rankings

Ya'll are damn point chasers! Just cause I had a bad week doesn't mean
I should drop *six* places in the coaches poll. Ayiyiyi. Gotta look at more
than one week of points. Look at team makeup...look at rest of season player rankings....
do some due diligence, damnit!

Rows explained:

* **FantasyPros** - Take the "Rest of Season" rankings on Thursday for all analysts that have updated recently
* **Coaches Poll Points** - Total points from coaches poll
* **First Place Votes** - Self explanatory
* **PowrSqor** - My own proprietary calculation that takes into account. This will be rough for a few weeks until we have real data..
    * Average Points
    * Average Points over the last 3 games
    * Aggregate Winning Percentage
    * Team Trade Value (based on CBS trade value chart)
* **Coaches Poll Normalized** - Take the coaches poll and normalize the values between 50 and 100
* **Average** - (Fantasy Pros + Coaches Poll Normalized + PowerSqor) / 3
 
Also, I don't make the FantasyPros rankings but apparently those dudes think my team will be very
solid the rest of the season...

Now that that's over, onto the *JUICY* stuff..

### Do you think there are too many neighborhood events, too few neighborhood events, or the right amount of neighborhood events?

Kind of an odd one for our Week 1 SurveyMonkey sponsored question..let's check out the results.

{{< pure_table
"Answer|Count|Percent"
"Far too many|0|0.00%"
"Too Many|2|16.67%"
"The Right Amount|6|50.00%"
"Too Few|4|33.33%"
"Far Too Few|0|0.00%"
>}}

At least we're all on the same page that there aren't too few *or* too many neighborhood events..

### Biggest Overreactions of Week 1

Our largest overreactions only got 8 out of 12 votes! I was definitely expecting at least one 12/12 and a couple 10/12s..
but here we are. Oh, and I guess no one would be surprised if the Brown's don't make the playoffs.

{{< pure_table
"Lamar Jackson will lead the NFL in TOTAL TDs|10|83.33%"
"Sammy \"The Lizard King\" Watkins will break Randy Moss's single season receiving TD record (record is 23, on pace for 48)|10|83.33%"
"The Cowboys will represent the NFC in the Super Bowl|8|66.67%"
"The Patriots will go undefeated in the regular season.|8|66.67%"
"The Steelers will lose enough to be a top-5 pick in next year's draft.|8|66.67%"
"The Texans and Saints will have an epic rematch in the Super Bowl|8|66.67%"
"The Packers will have a top-3 total defense at the end of the season|7|58.33%"
"The Vikings can make the playoffs without passing the ball (10 pass attempts in 28-12 win over Atlanta)|6|50.00%"
"Miami will go 0-16|5|41.67%"
"The Jags have won't win more than 3 games without Nick Foles|2|16.67%"
"The Browns will miss the playoffs|1|8.33%"

And that's all for week 1 folks! Thanks for filling out the survey!

#### Good luck on your Week 2 endeavours!!!!!!!!11
