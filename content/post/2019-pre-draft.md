# 2019 Pre-Draft Coaches Poll

The best part about a pre-draft poll is that there is no basis to answer upon other
than compiling the thoughts of our previous seasons together.

This leads to some very interesting answers...and without further ado, lets get started.

## Which owner will have the most side bets for the 2019 fantasy season?

This was a very split vote, with five of the twelve *dudes* being selected as options.
This leaves it up in the air as to who may take home the crown. Maybe someone not
on this list will be perplexed as to why their name wasn't chosen...and do something
about it. Personally I too believe it will be one of the top three.

## Which owner is most likely to get the tat?

This one was all over the board with seven out of 12 *dudes* being selected. The best part
is that **no one** expects a repeat! I'm sure Justin, D'James and myself appreciate that.
Let's make it happen.

## Which owner is most likely to take home the Jacket?

This one is great. I'm assuming that eight of us voted for ourselves, and the other four
just happened to distribute themselves evenly with the rest. So whoever didn't vote for
themselves is dum.

## What is the most sought after draft pick for 2019?

While this one had mixed feelings (6 different answers), it's clear that people wanted a pick in the
top six. All of the votes went to top 6, and even moreso, 75% of the vote went to 2, 3, and 4th overall.
I guess we'll have to see what the Fantasy Gods say about that.

## What is the least sought after draft pick for 2019?

Even more mixed feelings flooded this question. Five total answers in the top six, and seven in the bottom.
This just shows us that people really have no clue what a good draft position is, and what isn't. It's always
tough to determine, but given that positions 3 and 4 were top, and didn't show up on the least
sought after graph is a good indication that those are (to us as a league) the best positions to have.

## With the First pick in the 2019 Lathropolis draft, Team Clams selects...

Saquon Barkley. Run CMC. Zeke. Who will it be? No one knows. Not even me.

## Who will be the first owner to take a defense?

Dallman. With Jake as an underdog, and Justin as a sleeper. Wild.

## Aaron Rodgers or Brett Favre?

As amazing of a quarterback Aaron Rodgers is...he's no where close to as ELECTRIFYING as Favre was on the field.
Just watch this video.

## How bout that video?

For those of you who didn't watch...link [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVy9xH9n8Lo)

* "Holy Shit"
* "First I died laughing, then I died on the inside."
* "Wet."
* "Sexually charged."
* "Turned on."
* "Ain't finna watch that ish lol" (foff dude)
* "...we are all lucky to be doing as well as we are."
* "Uganda in six."
* "You dudes look like you're twelve."
* "It makes me feel good."
* "TL;DW" (foff dude)
* "Scared"

Wet, sexually charged, and turned on are all related, so I'll chalk that video up as a win. But I think
my personal favorite it "It makes me feel good."

## If James was an Animal, what animal would he be?

A DUGONG! Here's some interesting dugong facts.

* Dugong can reach length of 11 feet and weigh up to 2000 lbs.
* Dugong is a true sea vegetarian eating up to 88 pounds of seaweed daily.
* Dugong hits a top speed of 14 mph in the water, but usually swims aroun 6 mph.
* Dugong is "big boned" (literally) which help keep the animal submerged.
* Dugong reaches sexual maturity between ages of 9 and 15. Wild.
* Dugong can survive up to 70 years in protected habitats.

So basically James is a large, slow, vegetarian water elephant.

## What makes a great fantasy squad?

I guess the old addage "Defense wins championships" isn't as true as we all thought, with luck, top notch
mid-season pickups, and grit being the real factors in making a great fantasy squad.

## David Gruber or Habush Habush and Rottier?

Why choose anyone else? One Call, That's All!

{{< youtube pxUs1y-Ui1I >}}

{{< youtube hjb3RPJ3YD0 >}}

Habush Habush and Rottier edged out "I have no idea what is happening" by a single vote, with David Gruber
coming up short. Not worth a chart lol.

## After our 12 year tat rule, what should be next?

There's some lovely ones on here...and don't worry we'll have a vote on the best.

* Dedicating all our fantasy energies into conquering the UP
* Sports Illustrated Body Issue Calendar - 12 covers to make a calendar out of. Must create literal calendars and give them out to league members.
* Naming rights of next child
* More tats
* Children naming rights.
* Christ. Thinking that far down the road is giving me chest pain.
* Something that we decide on a yearly basis. Maybe the loser from the previous year gets 3 votes, and everybody else gets one.
* Loser has to have a kid
* License plate holder that reads “I suck at fantasy football”
* 12 more years of face tats
* Loser gets marooned on an island until next draft
* Shave the head

## Dudes, Guys, Bros, Hitta, or Men?

This was an easy one, with all twelve votes going towards Dudes and Guys.

Dudes, 8; Guys 4.

## 2017 Cleveland Browns or 2008 Detroit Lions?

Too close for comfort, with the Browns edging out the Lions 7 votes to 5. If you voted for the Lions,
you're simply wrong. Look at the outcome of this super duper accurate sports simulator.

*Here on this beautiful 70 degree day with no precipitation and no wind playing on a neutral stadium in Nashville, TN (Lions considered home team)
we have the 2017 Browns duking it out with the 2008 Lions*

*Here's your starting 6 for the Cleeeeeeveland Browwwwwwwns!*

* **QB** Deshone Kizer
* **RB** Isaiah Crowell
* **RB** Duke Johnson Jr.
* **WR** Ricardo Louis
* **WR** Rashard Higgins
* **TE** Seth DeValve

*And for your DEEEEETROOOOOOOOOIIIITT LIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNSSSS!!!!!!*

* **QB** Dan 'Big Chief' Orlovsky
* **RB** Kevin 'Nuggets' Smith
* **RB** Rudi 'The Guy' Johnson
* **WR** Calvin 'Megatron' Johnson
* **WR** Shaun 'Bada Ba Ba Baaaa' McDonald
* **TE** Michael 'The Butt' Gaines

Jesus christ. In a blowout fashion, the Cleveland Browns in 47-17. Isaiah Crowell Rushed for...236 yards and 2 touchdowns?
Deshone threw for 212 yards and 4 touchdowns? This can't be right...Let's run the sim again. (View the game [Here]https://www.whatifsports.com/nfl/boxscore.asp?gameid=24637281&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1())

Alright...for out next simulation...

This is more like it. The Cleveland Browns edge out the Detroit Lions in a riveting 12-6 victory!
The Browns scored two touchdowns, and missed both XPs lol. Meanwhile, Dan 'The Man' Orlovsky went 12-28 with 221 yards and 1 INT. Youch.

There you have it folks. The 2017 Browns are officially better than the 2008 Lions. (Box score [Here](https://www.whatifsports.com/nfl/boxscore.asp?gameid=24637372&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1))
