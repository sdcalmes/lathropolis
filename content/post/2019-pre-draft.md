# 2019 Pre-Draft Coaches Poll

The best part about a pre-draft poll is that there is no basis to answer upon other
than compiling the thoughts of our previous seasons together.

This leads to some very interesting answers...and without further ado, lets get started.

#### Which owner will have the most side bets for the 2019 fantasy season?

This was a very split vote, with five of the twelve *dudes* being selected as options.
This leaves it up in the air as to who may take home the crown. Maybe someone not
on this list will be perplexed as to why their name wasn't chosen...and do something
about it. Personally I too believe it will be one of the top three.

#### Which owner is most likely to get the tat?

This one was all over the board with seven out of 12 *dudes* being selected. The best part
is that **no one** expects a repeat! I'm sure Justin, D'James and myself appreciate that.
Let's make it happen.

#### Which owner is most likely to take home the Jacket?

This one is great. I'm assuming that eight of us voted for ourselves, and the other four
just happened to distribute themselves evenly with the rest. So whoever didn't vote for
themselves is dum.

#### What is the most sought after draft pick for 2019?

While this one had mixed feelings (6 different answers), it's clear that people wanted a pick in the
top six. All of the votes went to top 6, and even moreso, 75% of the vote went to 2, 3, and 4th overall.
I guess we'll have to see what the Fantasy Gods say about that.

#### What is the least sought after draft pick for 2019?

Even more mixed feelings flooded this question. Five total answers in the top six, and seven in the bottom.
This just shows us that people really have no clue what a good draft position is, and what isn't. It's always
tough to determine, but given that positions 3 and 4 were top, and didn't show up on the least
sought after graph is a good indication that those are (to us as a league) the best positions to have.

#### With the First pick in the 2019 Lathropolis draft, Team Clams selects...

Saquon Barkley. Run CMC. Zeke. Who will it be? No one knows. Not even me.

#### Who will be the first owner to take a defense?

Dallman. With Jake as an underdog, and Justin as a sleeper. Wild.

#### Aaron Rodgers or Brett Favre?

As amazing of a quarterback Aaron Rodgers is...he's no where close to as ELECTRIFYING as Favre was on the field.
Just watch this video.
