# Lathropolis Fantasy Football Week #5
In honor of a record setting performance by Vic this week, my theme is...
"Record-Breaking Box Office Movies: Lathropolis Edition"

### Avengers Infinity War (Sam vs. D'James)
![alt_text](../../2019/pre_draft/Cupace20191009192413.png)
This was a story you thought you could predict before you even saw the trailer. After all, how could just one villain take on a whole team of Avengers? In the Lathropolis version though, Samos only needed one infinity stone - the stone of Aaron Jones. Samos's had a few other minions (namely Godwin) to do his bidding, but once he put the green and gold Stone of Jones in his infinity beer, he turned my team to ash. 

I think we all knew that Sam's team was better than his early record, but sadly he will have to continue into the endgame without Borkley. I at least snuck out with a median win on the week, so I'm not complaining. Though I finally lost a communist bet, and will be the designated "Burny Boi". Well done Sam, good week. And if I had to lose to a lineup with a power-player, at least it was a Packer.

### Avatar (Victor vs. Luke)

In this realistic rewrite of Avatar, we see what actually would've happened on Pandora. Essentially, a heavily armed fleet of bionic super-soldiers decimated onto a planet of big blue people. Fowler managed to connect his ponytail and form the unbreakable bond with Amari Cooper, it wasn't enough to stop the unrelenting Blue Jean Committee. Thanks be to the hometree that the rest of us are not competing against the league mean, or Vic's skew squad would've hurt us all. 

To Fowler's credit, he has a whopping 743 points against, compared to the league average of 565. Next week will be a critical one as we see Sam and Fowler face off, two teams in ass-tat contention who would would love to see the other lose.

Well done Vic - perhaps next year we talk about a reward for the season high score? 

### Titanic (Andy vs. Matt)

This was supposed to be the movie representing the closest battle. One that was dramatic until the last play, and left us wanting more when it was over. Andy took it upon himself to flip the script. 

In this version of the Titanic, Rose (Andy) boarded the boat with a trash bag full of cocaine, and a dream. Rose proceeded to party with a shocking concentration of top 10 players, going so god-damn hard she didn't know if it was light or dark outside. Meanwhile Jack (Team XxGallmanationxX) was busy deflating Tom Brady's balls in the boiler room. All things considered, not a bad story - but nothing compared to what was going on in the penthouse. Will Rose's heart give out before the trip is over? Did she bring enough coke for the whole team? Only time will tell as we witness the clash of titans next week - Drew vs. Andy. 

Excellent week Andy, better luck next week Dallman.

### Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Joe vs. Joey)
![alt_text](../../2019/pre_draft/Cupace20191009191101.png)
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... Joe, a Fantasy Knight, fell in love with his team. After sucking Will Lutz's 50 yard shlong Week 1, he didn't know how he'd ever drop one of his prized players. Over the following weeks though, as Joe was busy battling to keep his ass tatless, his team slowly began to weaken. 

At this point Andy, Joe's long lost brother (and alleged "twin"), revealed to Joe that he was a Sith Colluder, hiding his identity at the top of the league ranks. Sith Andy told Joe that the only way to save his team was to learn the powers of the dark side. Joe pledged his allegiance to Sith Andy in the form of $3 FAAB, and together they plotted to rule the league.

Eventually, those who loved and supported Joe began to notice peculiar transactions with Sith Andy. Upon confrontation, a historic battle erupted on Planet GroupMe, where Drewbi-Wan stopped Joe from killing Justin, leaving Joe dismembered and suffering in the planet's harsh conditions.

After the fiery lava of the Planet GroupMe burnt Joe to a crisp, he adopted the name Darth Collusion. Although Darth Collusion hasn't constructed a week-to-week "Death Star" team yet, the Empire is a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately for Joey, he is in Revenge of the Sith, and the good guy doens't win this one.  

The actual reason I picked this movie for this matchup is that both teams are pretty sick. Simply put, they both have tons of players who know how to shred. Hats off to both of you for being above the median, and well done Joe.

### Harry Potter (Drew vs. James)
![alt_text](../../2019/pre_draft/Cupace20191009192013.png)
The best movie on this list, and the best matchup of the week, involving two of the best teams in our league. This was a nail-biter until the end and it appeared Drew, The Chosen One, was going to come back to life and take a victory. The Chosen One even had the help of Severous Slye working in his interest from within Lord Steckemort's team.

In this Lathropolis rewrite though, Lord Steckemort reigned supreme after Avada-KaBoyd'ing Drew with the supreme Leonard FournElder Wand. Both teams had points left on the bench, but in the words of Albus Dumbledore...

*"It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities".*

Neither team managed to beat the median, which I guess compares to falling in love with your best friend's underage sister - not a good look Harry. Shout out to one of the best bets of the season though. Please make Drew eat something worse than chocolate.

### Dazed and Confused (Justin vs. Jake)
![alt_text](../../2019/pre_draft/Cupace20191009192603.png)
A movie that didn't make the list, and a matchup where neither side broke 100. 
I don't know which team is "Dazed" and which is "Confused", but ESPN Lathroplis Edition reports most of these players are looking to get traded. On the upside, the former orphans of "Team 8" now have a name! Stay tuned next week to see if anybody gets a nickname... maybe if they're well-behaved.
On Justin's side of things, we have seen some internal conflict, suggesting that some of his players are trying to get him tatted. Its worth noting that the next two weeks are going to be rough matchups for Team Shred, taking on Victor and then Andy. 
Congrats on the win Jake - best of luck to both of you.
