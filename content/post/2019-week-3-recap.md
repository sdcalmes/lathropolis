## Week 3 Recap

We enter week 4 amidst a fantasy scandal. I originally wanted this article to celebrate the wonderful
comradery that we share and the competitions we endure. I wanted to articulate what makes our
league a great example of friendship and brotherhood. Instead, we are facing the darkest moment since
the loss of our beloved feline, Bill Whiskers. At the time I am writing this, no decisions have been made,
Justin stormed out of the group and Joe and Andy have dumbfounded us… I’d be lying if I wasn’t
concerned about the state of league affairs. It’s fitting, that in a year of clickbait news stories, we have
an emerging headline on our hands…

*“Integrity of Lathropolis nearly split by our Keal”*

Now for the fun stuff! In the spirit of breaking news stories, this week we will be comparing each team’s
performance and season outlook with some of my favorite news stories from r/WeirdNews.

### Team jfolzy (4-2-0)
#### *“Great Grandmother, 73, kills venomous cobra slithering in her backyard with a shovel”*
What ever happened to Z-Wolf? Who knows, but jfolzy is off to a rockin start sitting with a 4-2 record.
Was it the prettiest game in the world? Aboslutely not, in fact, only 4 of his players scored more than 10
points and he didn’t even reach the league median. I imagine this win went about as well as the 73 year
old taking on a cobra. Was it clean? Was it quick? Mostly likely not, but a win is a win, and he has the
skin to show for it.

### Saquon DEEZ NUTZ (0-6-0)
#### *“Tanker spills 32,000 liters of gin on M6 motorway”*
A rough start would be an understatement for the DEEZ NUTZ squad. Not only is Sam winless through 3
weeks of the season, but his biggest playmaker has gone down for what is being estimated at 8 weeks.
There doesn’t look to be an end in sight…which is what the Englishmen said about traffic while being
stuck on the M6 motorway.

---
### D’Brettshaw Favruson (4-2-0)
#### *“Woman in US is charged with peeing on potatos"*
You know what sucks? Losing after scoring 120 points. You know what else sucks? Going to jail for
pissing on a potato. I can’t explain either, but both feel like a shitty way to end your day. Ultimately, Joey
has a team that is hitting its stride at a good time. 5 players with 15+ points but no help from the kicker
once again. Maybe, if he can figure out his kicking woe’s, he can piss on his potatoes in peace.

---
### Team Shred (1-5-0)
#### *“Elderly woman dies after being pecked by an “aggressive rooster”, highlighting the dangers of varicose veins”*
Close your eyes and Imagine someone being pecked to death by an aggressive rooster... Now open your
eyes… I don’t know about you, but I saw Justin getting torn a part mentally and physically by that cock.
There might not be a worse way to go down, and the saddest part was that it was avoidable. That
rooster didn’t play by the rules and everyone knows it. Justin didn’t put up much of a fight and probably
deserved to go down anyway, but in cock fighting all that matters is the rooster that stands across from
you in the ring. It’s just a shame that this one was secretly equipped with a titanium pecker.

---
### Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck (6-0-0)
#### *“Texas Butthole Tickling Bandit still on the loose”*
Who goes around tickling buttholes? And why is he still on the loose? These are questions that I can’t
fully answer, same with how Drew’s team has not a blemish on his record. But somebody better catch
these dudes quickly, otherwise no L column or butthole is safe.

---
### Mertle’s Acres (3-3-0)
#### *“A powerful unknown source of radiation discovered under Antarctica”*
*Quivering Intensifies*

---
### Ligma Sacks (2-4-0)
#### *“British Parrot missing for four years returns home speaking fluent Spanish”*
Let’s ignore the Loss, that shouldn’t have happened. Luke’s team has gone on a journey of discovery
through the first 3 weeks. Much like the Parrot who went missing, Luke’s team was nowhere to be
found early on. But he’s back, he’s cultured, and he’s talking that spicy español. If Mike Evans is back for
real like the Spanish turkey he is, Luke’s team is not to be messed with.

---
### Team mdallman 2570 (2-4-0)
#### *“Woman Puts octopus on face, ends up in hospital”*
Hey Dallman, get a new name…

It’s tough to have a successful fantasy team when you start players like Ty Johnson. It’s tough to stay
healthy when you put an octopus on your face. I think the lessons here are simple, yet not obvious for
everyone. Dallman is due for some roster changes. He needs to look himself in the mirror and pry that
octopus off if he’s got a shot of turning this season around.

---
### The Blue Jean Committee (4-2-0)
#### *“Opium addicted Parrots are terrorizing poppy fields”*
Any game against Sam right now is a gimme. Much like I imagine Parrots ravaging an unsupervised
poppy field would be. The Blue Jean committee has had two great performances this season but some
question if his team has the talent to take him to the top. Are they ready to finally make a playoff push?
Or are they just some crazed group of parrots taking advantage of poorly placed poppy fields. In my
opinion, animal control is on its way.

---
### Kupp o Caffe (5-1-0)
#### *“Gold toilet stolen in Blenhem Palace”*
Andy’s success is a result of thievery. His team might be the worst in the league, yet he sits with a 5-1
record through the first 3 weeks. Over performances from Frat Ryan, Adam Feline and Scooper Kupp
have led him to believe his shit don’t stink. But let me tell you…it does stink…stinks like shit! He may be
holding the golden throne at the moment, but eventually everyone’s going to be taking dumps in it.

---
### BakeHer? I barely kno her (3-3-0)
#### *“Teen couldn’t get a date a prom, he took his Cat”*
A win is a win, until its not. This game doesn’t look right, it doesn’t feel right. It’s almost like watching a
guy take his cat to prom because he couldn’t get a date the regular way. Is it legal? To be honest, I’m not
so sure…would the school let a kid take a cat into prom? I can’t say for sure, but it’s definitely wrong and
has no place in modern society. Joe may have the satisfaction of victory, but his team, much like his
prom date, isn’t going to give him the goods at the end of the night. Unless of course, he *rents* a hotter
date next time.

---
### Sons of Ol’ (2-4-0)
#### **“Scientists accidentally created a cocktail of immortality”**
Who says spending $32 on Frank Gore was a bad idea? You know who Frank Gore outscored this week?
Todd Gurley, Derrick Henry, Leonard Fornette, Ezekiel Elliot, Chris Carson, Josh Jacobs, Saquon Barkley,
Le’Veon Bell…the list goes on. Point is, the man is truly immortal. D’James team looks well balanced, and
much stronger than the 2-4-0 record he boasts. Sleep with your eyes open, Frank Gore is watching…
