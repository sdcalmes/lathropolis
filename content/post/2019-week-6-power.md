## Week 6 Power Rankings

Classic Andy, Drew, Victor and D'James holding the top spots. Then shit gets tight. While some teams are looking
weaker than others, it's still anyone's ball game. There's a lot of football left to play.

But with that being said, team *On the Rise* is exactly what his name says...ON THE RISE. LEGGOOOOO

### Let's get to it.

### How many days in a typical week do you use shampoo?

Ten 7's, one 5, and one...2. Jesus, that some stank.

**Some Notes**

* Joe Flacco sucks nuts can't believe that guy was ever in the *elite* talks holy shit he is garbage.
* We need a real 3 way trade sometime this year.
* Sucks to see Mahomies down, hope he's okay.
* Drew now has Alvin, Saquon, and Tyreek in his starting lineup. Godspeed.

#### Thanks for checking out the week 6 rankings, and good luck y'all!!
