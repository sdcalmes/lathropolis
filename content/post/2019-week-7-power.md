## Oh how the turn tables..

Comin' to ya live just hours before Thursday Night Football kicks off are some rankings HOT off the stove.

With 'On the Rise' literally on the rise, and 'KittleMyTittles' falling the most places this week, we are at an
interesting point in the fantasy season.

* Halfway through the regular season and we have 43% of the FAAB budget left in play.
* Fowler has more points against than the team that has the most points for (973 v 967)
* Z Wolf scores 104.7 points per game, Andy scores a whopping 161.2. That's INSANITY!!!! (Fuck kickers and defenses)
* 7 teams are still within two games of each other, fighting for 4th, 5th, and 6th place.
* Andy's ass team went 2-0 last week; horseshit
* We had the highest waiver pickup of the year in Ty Johnson for $46, just edging out Wayne Gallman at $43 (unless
 you want to consider Frank Gore and Peyton Barber as one person for $64...)
* Jake is the worst manager, starting only 79.97% of his possible points...as well has having the lowest possible
 points.
* Drew, in all his glorious wisdom, is the best manager; starting 92.86% of his possible points

#### Let's get to some RANKINGS
