# Week 4 Recap

Oh suh dudes. Comin' to you live from my couch, the Brewers currently lead the Nationals 3-1.
I hope it stays that way.

After some week 3 debacles, I bring you the week 4 recap. This will most likely be the **worst** recap
of the year. I am writing this live, with no research and nothing to base it off of.

### *No Mo' Squancho vs The Jets Defense Fan Club

In the left corneer we have the 0-6 No Mo Squanchos who really really really need a damn win, and in the right corner we
have the questionable Jets Defense Fan Club (lol). The NoMoSquanchos really needed a win this week, even if it ended up
just being one. While his RBs didn't put much together for yardages, they put enough together to win him the game. NoMoSquancho
would go on to take 2 for himself this weak, while The Jets Defense Fan Club would drop both.

### The Blue Jean Commitee vs XxGallmanationxX

Finally, Dallman changes his team name. Also, Vic, it's spelled *committee*, not commitee. Anywho, Dallman thought the big
pick up of the week would take him to the promised land, but what a surprise. He didn't. Not even Wayne Gallman's 24.8
points could lead this team to a 2-0 week. At least James Connor was able to salvage the week and go 1-1.

As The Blue Jean Committee put it.....*The Wayne Train was hit by the Mack Truck*!

### Kupp o Caffe vs Ligma Sacks

Once again, Kupp o Caffe shows his strength and continues to put up massive numbers, while Ligma Sacks couldn't quite muster
up the 107 it would take to go 1-1. There are rumblings on the street that Kupp o Caffe is ready for a regression though...


### Team Shred vs Mertle's Acres

Earlier in the week when Mertle's Acres was trying to swing trades with me he brought up to me the fact that he *needs to
beat Justin this week*. Well ya know what , *Mertle's Acres*, maybe you should've traded with me! Your team is trash.

Team Shred goes 2-0 and Mertle's Acres drops both in a devastating defeat.

### Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck vs Team 8

Jake, c'mon. New team name. Now. Do it.

Stupid Drew was able to put up 93 points and still pull out a 1-1 week. There's the luck factor for ya folks. Remember these
times when we do a vote on the median again next year.

### D'Brettshaw Favruson vs Sons of Ol'

Yoish JJanz. Rough week. Although I did see a guy on reddit with a very valid lineup put up only 18 points, so at least you would
have beat him. Once again, Sons of Ol' with a solid outing. Sneaky solid team he's got over there putting up at least 113 points
in all 4 weeks.

##### Thanks for reading this garbage recap. If you send me a Venmo request with the description: "*Little Larry likes licking the sticky lollipops*", I'll send you 3 cents.
