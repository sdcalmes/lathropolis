## How bow dah Week 6

We sometimes refer to ourselves, our teams, or individual players as being beasts. Indeed some teams truly are bestial in nature, both in terms of weekly prowess and the raw animal magnetism of their owners. In an adjunct manner, we also assign ourselves spirit animals as idiosyncratic manifestations of our pysche. Whether you would rather soar with the eagles by day or hoot with the owls by night there is an animal spirit in all of us. So just as Dulcea did in Bryan Spicer&#39;s Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I will assign each of you Animal Spirits this week based on your team&#39;s performance. Those spirits will then be pitted against each other in epic death battles of ultimate destiny

**Matchup #1 Darth Collusion vs. Mertle&#39;s Acres**

_Blobfish vs. Blind Squirrel_

Let&#39;s get right into it. In 2013 the blobfish was voted the most hideous species on earth. In a week where I only had one player score in double digits, I can think of no better representation of my team than the most aesthetically challenged of Mother Nature&#39;s children. Check out this fun fact:

&quot;Lacking both bones and teeth, they do not actively hunt. In fact, their extremely low muscle mass doesn&#39;t allow for much movement at all. Besides eating, conserving energy is the blobfish&#39;s main job.&quot;

Neat! On the other side of the arena, wiry and erratic, we have a blind squirrel. This creature is capable of great bursts of speed and can also remain painfully still for long periods of time. Players like Henry and Hopkins put on some big bursts and others like Lindsay and McManus stood absolutely still. In this matchup, Mertle&#39;s squirrel simply had to run around with their mouth open until they latched onto Darth Collusion&#39;s blobfish. It may have been a longshot for the blind squirrel to win this week at the onset, but as the saying goes, even a Mertle eventually gets that sweet, sweet nut.

**Matchup #2 On the Rise vs. XxGallmanationxX**

_Polar Bear vs. Silverback Gorilla_

Now this is more like it, a matchup for the ages. Do you have any idea how much the average male polar bear weighs? 990 pounds!! That being said, gorillas have the strength to bend iron bars, have opposable thumbs, and possess twice the bite strength of lions. Across the board Sam the Polar bear was more consistent and managed to put up the third most points in the league. He took his swipes, rearing back on his powerful haunches with Jacoby Brissett and Aaron Jones. Unfortunately for Sam and Golden Compass fans everywhere, all it takes is one good thwack. Dallman raised the mighty fists of Aaron Rodgers and Rams D and brought them down with crushing force on the nape of the bears neck. Instantly paralyzed, it wasn&#39;t long before tired and bloodied, Dallman finished what he started.

**Matchup #3 Wolf vs. Sons of Ol&#39;**

_Three-toed sloth vs. Giant Tortoise_

This was an old fashioned war of attrition. Both teams lumbered around occasionally throwing a bite here and a scratch there. It was a reciprocal dance of Lingchi as each player laid small cuts upon the other. Slow. Methodical. This one could have gone either way, but in the end Jake&#39;s sloth was able to prevail by flipping the tortoise on his back with the burst of energy provided from Jared Goff&#39;s comeback performance.

**Matchup #4 Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck vs. The Blue Jean Committee**

_Burmese Python vs. Alligator_

SSsssssssss…….  SSsssssss….. Sneaky and slippery slinks the slithering serpentine supervisor. It didn&#39;t matter that Alvy was out this week, Drew still put up his now trademark top tier numbers. The gator performed well with gnashing teeth and thrashing tail and aside from an injured Will Fuller and an abysmal Lions Defense he was solid across the board. He took some solid chunks out of the python and most days would have prevailed, but the commissssshhhhhh is not to be denied. After a wacky week, Drew will now join Slick Vick in a two-way tie for second near the top of the leaderboard.

As an aside, go look up videos of pythons eating alligators! That shit&#39;s crazy!

**Matchup #5 D&#39;Brettshaw Favruson vs. Poop Emoji**

_Human (Unnamed Zookeeper) vs. Harambe_

He was the best of us. A majestic creature loved posthumously by millions by virtue of his tragic passing. This was never a fair fight from the onset. Lucas&#39;s Harambe saw a child he could nurture in David Johnson, only for that child to betray him. It took but minutes for Joey&#39;s Zookeeper to extinguish one of the great pillars of this world; Luke&#39;s uninked booty. Brother Luke will have to channel the spirit of harambe going forward to keep those cheeks squeeky clean as this week was a complete and utter annihilation. Joey will look to keep his spot at the top of the animal kingdom going forward as he takes on a tough matchup next week against Drew and his python.

**Matchup #6 Team Shred vs. Kupp o Caffe**

_Lion vs. Shark_

Holy Cats! I haven&#39;t seen a finish that close since Will Lutz&#39;s Week 1 hawg swing. Thanks to the Patriots Defense being the greatest cheatcode since &quot;Rosebud&quot; in the Sims, Caffe is never out of it until the final whistle. Scrap kickers, scrap defenses, scrap everything, that was nothing short of thrilling. This death match is one of two fearsome predators. Both lethal in their own terrain, this one could have been anyone&#39;s game. Unfortunately for Justin&#39;s lion, Andy&#39;s shark got the perfect matchup; a date with Sam Darnold and the Patriots defense. That is to say, the match took place underwater. Despite some fearsome swipes Shred drowned under the weight of 4 interceptions. I would be more mad about you making me stay up to write this if it wasn&#39;t so dagum exciting!!

Just as Dulcea taught us, &quot;To those who possess the Great Power, all things are possible&quot;. I see a Great Power in each of you, but it is up to you to unleash it. Keep making trades. Hop on that waiver wire. Rent a player or two. No matter what your strategy is spread those wings, flap those fins, and above all be kind.
