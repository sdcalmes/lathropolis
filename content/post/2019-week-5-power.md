## Week 5 Power Rankings

Howdy ya'll. So happy we got 12 responses on the survey, that's what I live for.

Nothing new at the top, with Andy, Victor, Drew, and D'James staying in the top four for two weeks now.

The middle though...an absolute mess. Not only is it a power ranking mess, but we have 8 teams with between 3 and 5
 wins.
 
I know it's still early, but hot damn this is shaping up to be another SPICY year. I can't wait to see how it plays
out.
  
#### Let's get to it.

### Staff are treated fairly when they make mistakes.

The point of this question was to see what percent of our dudes were abused at work when they make mistakes.

If we lump together the disagrees as wellas the "neither agree nor disagree", looks like 50% of our dudes are treated
 unfairly (abused) when they make mistakes. We also had a does not apply/does
 not know, so I'll count that as abused. That's 7/12 dudes that are getting abused after a mistake. Seek help.
 
 * **Strongly Disagree** - *8.33%*
 * **Disagree** - *25.00%*
 * **Neither Agree nor Disagree** - *16.67%*
 * **Agree** - *33.33%*
 * **Strongly Agree** - *8.33%*
 * **Does Not Apply or Don't Know** - *8.33%*
