# Week 1 Recap

Welcome back gentlemen!
Another year of fantasy football has begun and boy did we start off with a bang!
We witnessed:

* The closest game of all time between Dalls House and Foxy Fowler G
* A game that was won by one swing of Will Lutz's phat hog
* Andy doing his best James impression by losing with the second highest score.

This much excitement shouldn’t even be legal and that’s just what we saw on the field.
The league has already lit their torches and searched for their pitchforks a half-dozen times already
regarding the rule changes and we haven’t even done our first waiver wire.
Hang in there boys, we’ll give it a few more weeks before deciding if to **RIOT**. 
This week we’ll be taking a look at each matchup and comparing it to a *BANGER*.
Without further ado, here are this weeks’ matchups:

<p style="margin: 40px"></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"> Matchup #1 - Team 10 vs. Ligma Sacks</h3>
Song: Close ft. Tove Lo - Nick Jonas

Close, oOOOoOOOh!
Oh, so close, oOOooOO!

Oohhhhhh mama what an experience. This game was decided by 0.05 points after a Monday night thriller that, all fantasy
implications aside, was a hoot and a half. Luke used the combined power of 2 D. Johnson’s to squeak this one out.
Famous Jameis did his best to throw the game and TY Hilton put up some big time numbers but in the end Ligma was just
too much. Is this fantasy karma for not filling out that dang survey? The jury is out on that one, but what is obvious
is that you need a new team name Matthew!

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Matchup #2 - Mertle’s Acres vs. Team 8</h3>
Song: Hot N Cold - Katy Perry

Another game decided by less than 2 points! This game was a story of fantasy studs and fantasy duds. Mertle’s receivers
accounted for over half his points while his kicker and defense put up a putrid 4.60 combined. On the other side of the
aisle Jake’s second and third overall picks (MIxon and Cooks) couldn’t get anything going but he got some surprise booms
from the ageless Delanie Walker and the discount Purple People Eater defense. Sleeper says Jake is the worst Coach for
not playing Sammy Watkins but that just means a deep bench to me. Both teams could be formidable moving forward but
Jake’s would be much more intimidating with a new name!

<p style="margin: 40px"></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Matchup #3 - The Blue Jean Committee vs. Kupp o Caffe</h3>
Song: Make it Nasty - Tyga

McNasty, McNasty
Pop pop it on a bitch, McNasty

If I’m doing a bit using song titles, how can I not give a shout out to my number one hitta? Sure Big Brother may not
have won but getting to watch the nastiest running back in the game go off for 38 has to count for something right?
Also of note is that despite being roasted for his early Defense and Kicker picks, they combined for 25.4 points
and outscored his opponent by 19. Time will tell if this was a boner decision or a bone-her decision. And what can
I even say about The Committee? They scored the most points this week and look solid across the board. Once AJ
Green gets added to this team… Bitches they know, yeah, bitches they know. Ha

<p style="margin: 40px"></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Matchup #4 - Saquon DEEZ NUTS vs. D’Brettshaw Favruson</h3>
Song: Don’t Know Why - No(r)A(h) Jones

There was NO A JONES… hahhahaa get it? Ooh boy these are getting worse by the second. This matchup was the lowest
scoring of the week and both lads were punished by the mighty hammer of the league median. DEEZ NUTS low score of
the week was in part due to the lack of production from Green Bay’s favorite running back. Both have some promising
pieces on their bench and will look to put together a better showing in week two.

<p style="margin: 40px"></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Matchup #5  - Tuck Tuck Grey Tuck vs. Team Shred</h3>
Song: La(mar) Bamba - Ritchie Valens

This game was a clinical dismantling of what was voted the worst team on paper (but they have potential!). Everyone
not named Mark Andrew or Carson Wentz underperformed and Tyreek the Freak got injured which led to a shredded
butthole for Team Shred. On the other side of the field Lamar was throwing Bomb(a)s up and down the field as the
top quarterback this week. Drew got some solid performances across the board. He’ll look to continue this level of
play next week against the most dashingly handsome manager in the league and his team of stud-muffins

<p style="margin: 40px"></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">Matchup #6 - BakeHer? I barely kno her vs. Sons of Ol’</h3>
Song: Beautiful Downtown Lutz - John “Lutz” Ritter

This one was stressful for all parties involved to say the least. Who would have guessed that a 2 game swing would
come down to a 57 yarder from one of the games’ bright young stars (and winner of many unused beer haves). There is
room for improvement on both teams but both had a strong showing in week one. As I’m typing this news just broke
about AB’s ALLEGED assault. Needless to say I’m triggered and need a safe space free of AB bad news. 

All in all this was a great week of fantasy but as the Fantasy Footballers, which I don’t watch, always say, “The
league is not won in the draft”. There’s a long season ahead with many exciting twists and turns and I can’t wait to
experience them all with you gents. You are the Gabriellas’ to my Troy and Fantasy Football is the music in me.
